# Homework 6 - Server Side APIs Weather Dashboard

## Description

I created a weather generator.  When the user searches for a city, the cities current weather and 5-day forecast are populated. For the current weather, I am presented with the city's name, the date, an icon of the weather conditions, the temperature, the umidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.  The UV index changes color depending on how bad it is.  For the future weather conditions, I see a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon for the weather conditions, the tempreature, and the wind speed.
